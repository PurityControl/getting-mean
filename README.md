#start the app

There are 3 ways to start the app
- `node app.js`
- `npm start` (just launches above via package.json)
- `nodemon app.js` (if nodedemon is installed)

# installing nodedemon

nodemon will automatically restart your node server if files 
change so you don't have to interrupt the development process.
nodemon is installed as part of the provisioning script in vagrant.

`sudo npm install -g nodemon`
